Electricity Billing System Project  

This Electricity Billing System is a Java-based application designed to replace traditional paper-based billing with an efficient electronic system. Developed as part of my Java learning journey, the project automates billing operations and simplifies management.  

 Key Features:  
- Digital Records: Eliminates paper bills by maintaining electronic data.  
- Automated Fines: Calculates fines accurately for overdue payments.  
- Online Payments: Allows users to pay bills without visiting the office.  
- No Manual Delivery: Saves resources by removing the need for bill delivery.  
- Admin Management: Simplifies user and billing management for administrators.  

 Technologies Used:  
- Java Core: For business logic.  
- Swing: For the graphical interface.  
- JDBC: For database connectivity.  
- MySQL: For secure data storage.  

This project demonstrates my ability to design systems that enhance operational efficiency, save resources, and improve user convenience.
